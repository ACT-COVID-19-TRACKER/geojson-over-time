# geojson-over-time

A demo of GeoJSON over time visualisation to help requirements elicitation. Uses
the [Mapbox API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/).

## Use

It's served by GitHub Pages, so any commits that you push to GitHub will be
built & served at <https://act-covid-19-tracker.github.io/geojson-over-time/>.
It's just plain html & js, though---it's not a Jekyll site.

If you want to test locally (always a good idea---don't push unless you're sure
it won't break the build) then you can use a "live server" (e.g. [this
one](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server)) in this directory to run it on
your local machine.
